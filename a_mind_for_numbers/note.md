# Chapter 1: Focused vs diffuse mode
- Your mind has 2 modes, basically thinknig fast and slow
- Each has its own pros/cons and you need to learn how to use it effectively when learning.
- Focused mode is most effective when you try get something out of things you already know, like doing a local optimization. It uses the frontal cortex of the brain
- Diffuse mode is most effective when you learn new things because you want to use your whole brain so it connects lots of dots. Like doing a global optimization.
- When thinking too hard you can get stuck in a local maxima so the best effort is to relax a shift to diffuse mode.


Tips for learning:
- skim through the headings first before diving in so you can build a map of when you can learn befoe acutally learn it.
- Do "pause and recall" once in a while
