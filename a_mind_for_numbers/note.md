# Chapter 1: Focused vs diffuse mode
- Your mind has 2 modes, basically thinknig fast and slow
- Each has its own pros/cons and you need to learn how to use it effectively when learning.
- Focused mode is most effective when you try get something out of things you already know, like doing a local optimization. It uses the frontal cortex of the brain
- Diffuse mode is most effective when you learn new things because you want to use your whole brain so it connects lots of dots. Like doing a global optimization.
- When thinking too hard you can get stuck in a local maxima so the best effort is to relax a shift to diffuse mode.

Tips for learning:
- skim through the headings first before diving in so you can build a map of when you can learn befoe acutally learn it.
- Do "pause and recall" once in a while

- Procastination is dangerous because the longer you procastinate, the less time you have to finish the thing and it compounds with the pressure of finishing it.
- Start the day with the hard problems

# Chapter 3: learning is creating
- It's actually a good practice to break between focused mode with diffuse mode with activity like: playing video games, surf web, do short exercises, listen to a song.
- Spaced repetitions: repeat after awhile what you've learned, this makes the knowledge write hard to your long term memory.
- Importance of sleep: when you're awake, your brain create toxic products that make you think less clearly. Sleep will clean this up.
